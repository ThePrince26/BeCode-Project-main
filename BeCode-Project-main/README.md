# BeCode Project

Description:

#Data Scrapping

#Data Visualization

For this first data analysis project, I asked the following two questions to the dataset obtained after scrapping the Immoweb Website ;

1) What's the relationship between a furnished apartment to rent in Brussels on its price versus an unfurnished apartment ?
2) How does having a garden in a furnished house affect the price when you want to buy a house in the center of Antwerp ?

The graphs aim to answer these two questions.

#Machine Learning

In the file "machine learning", I built a very basic pipeline that gave me a very low number (0.05). I was not satisfied. The cleaning of Florent's database would have taken too long, I decided to use Anil's. 

I tried to build a linear regression model but it gave again a low value (0.2). The random regression was much accurate though (0.74). I was pretty happy with that.

I learned a lot in this project. At the preprocessing dropped the na value and the nul value.

Installation:

#Data Scrapping
#Data Visualization

To obtain my graphs, I had to import the following librairies ;

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

#Machine Learning

- Pandas
- numpy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- warnings

Usage:

#Data Scrapping
#Data Visualization

This code is only useful to understand the logic of pandas and a data analysis project.
The graphs can only be used for the sake of this first data analysis project.

#Machine Learning

The machine learning will deliver accurate price predictions of the real estate market in Belgium.

Timeline:

#Data Scrapping
#Data Visualization

Getting familiar with Pandas, doing exercices, watching to tutorials on YouTube,
Day 6 & 7 : Creating the code & obtaining the visuals.
I didn't have enough time to clean my data in the way that I wanted and to make the graphs more "sexy"
but it was nevertheless a good first exercice. I will do a better job next time.
