# Data Visualization
Description:
For this first data analysis project, I asked the following two questions to the dataset obtained after scrapping the Immoweb Website ;
1) What's the relationship between a furnished apartment to rent in Brussels on its price versus an unfurnished apartment ?
2) How does having a garden in a furnished house affect the price when you want to buy a house in the center of Antwerp ?

The graphs aim to answer these two questions.

Installation:
To obtain my graphs, I had to import the following librairies ;
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

Usage:
This code is only useful to understand the logic of pandas and a data analysis project. 
The graphs can only be used for the sake of this first data analysis project.

Visuals:
The visuals are obtain thanks to Matplotlib.

Timeline:
Day 1 - Day 5 : Getting familiar with Pandas, doing exercices, watching to tutorials on YouTube, 
Day 6 & 7 : Creating the code & obtaining the visuals.
I didn't have enough time to clean my data in the way that I wanted and to make the graphs more "sexy" 
but it was nevertheless a good first exercice. I will do a better job next time.
